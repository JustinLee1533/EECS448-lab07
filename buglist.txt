1. it looks like when a list is created, its size is initialized to 1.  It should start at 0.

2. the first time addBack() is called it adds the proper value to the list.  After its called a subsequent time, it always adds what the first value in the list (?whats it do if addfront is called first?)

3. removeFront() removes the last elements from a list, at least when the list is populated just by addFront();
